# RamboQuant Admin Guide

> Read [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) first for concepts; this file is the operations reference.

**Quick start — test an auto-close rule before activating**:
1. `/agents` → `loss-pos-total-auto-close` → **Run in Simulator**
2. Watch the **Simulator** tab at the bottom — one `SELL` line per position
3. Flip **ON** when confident

---

## Core concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Agent** | A rule row: "if X, notify me and maybe do Y" |
| **Alert** | Runtime event when rule triggers |
| **Notify** | Delivery channel (Telegram / email / log) |
| **Action** | Side-effect (place order, close position, …) |

Agent as a sentence: **"When _condition_, _notify_ and _do_ these actions."**

### Firing rules (prevent spam)

- **Static agents** — fire once at threshold crossing, latch silent while condition holds, re-arm on recovery
- **Rate agents** — re-fire when bleeding accelerates (gated by cooldown + material-change threshold)
- **Session rollover** — clears all latch state daily

---

## Order Templates — auto-attach TP/SL/trail on position fill

Pick a template at order entry → platform attaches broker-native GTT when position fills. Multi-broker coverage (Sprint C):

| Broker | TP single | SL single | OCO (TP+SL) | Trail (modify GTT) | MCX / commodity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Kite | ✅ native | ✅ native | ✅ native | ✅ native | ✅ |
| Dhan | ✅ native | ✅ native | ✅ native (Forever Order) | ✅ native | ❌ Forever doesn't cover MCX — `place_gtt` raises a clear `RuntimeError` |
| Groww | ✅ native | ✅ native | ⚠ emulated (two singles + 15s pair-watcher) | ❌ no modify_gtt | ✅ (single-trigger only) |

When the operator picks a template whose features exceed the selected broker's natives, OrderTicket renders an amber capability warning chip below the template summary:
- "Groww OCO emulated — ~15s race window"
- "Dhan can't trail — SL stays fixed" (only on brokers without `modify_gtt`)
- "{broker} has no GTT — scale-out won't attach"

The chip is sourced from `GET /api/admin/brokers/{account}/capabilities` — a pure read of the `BrokerCapabilities` dataclass; no broker round-trip.

### `/admin/templates` page

Columns: Name | TP | SL | Trail | Wing | Scale | Active | Default (radio). Edit form fields: name / description / tp_type / tp_pct / tp_abs / sl_pct / sl_abs / sl_trail_pct / wing_strike_offset / wing_premium_pct / tp_scales_json.

Row chips: `TP` (tp_pct/tp_abs) · `SL` (sl_pct/sl_abs) · `SL X% trail` · `WING ±N` · `Scale ×M` · `MKT` (if MARKET, else LIMIT default)

### OrderTicket integration

Two-pill toggle: `[Default ✓]` (uses marked default) or `[None]` (no exits). Shows inline summary: `"TP +50%, SL −1%, Scale ×3"`.

### OrderCard exit-rule chip

After fill: `tmpl:#1 ✓` (all GTTs placed) or `tmpl:#1 …` (placing, ~1 sec) or none. Tooltip: template name + summary.

### Settings (`/admin/settings → templates.*`)

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `wing_min_oi` | 1000 | Filter illiquid strikes |
| `wing_max_spread_pct` | 10 | Max bid-ask spread % |
| `wing_chain_radius` | 20 | ±N strikes around parent |
| `trail_poll_interval_seconds` | 30 | LTP check frequency for trailing stop |
| `oco_pair_poll_seconds` | 15 | Sibling-cancel check for emulated OCO (Groww) |

### Seeded system templates

| Template | TP | SL | Wing | Scale | Trail |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `default-long-option` | +80% MARKET | none | none | none | none |
| `default-short-vol` | +10% LIMIT | −20% LIMIT | −1 strike | none | none |

### API routes (admin-guarded)

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/templates` | List all (system + user-created) |
| `GET /api/admin/templates/{id}` | Read one |
| `POST /api/admin/templates` | Create custom template |
| `PATCH /api/admin/templates/{id}` | Edit (including setting is_default; auto-demotes prior default) |
| `DELETE /api/admin/templates/{id}` | Delete (including seeded ones if customized away) |
| `POST /api/orders/ticket` | Place order with template. Template ID optional in request body. |

### Execution flow at order fill

1. Operator enters order + picks template (or uses default)
2. `POST /api/orders/ticket` validates mode (templates on LIVE / PAPER only)
3. Broker.place_order() fires; order lands
4. Order fill detected (Kite postback or chase engine terminal)
5. `apply_template_to_order()` resolves TP/SL/wing/scale/trail → N GTT specs
6. For each spec: `broker.place_gtt()` fires → enters broker's GTT engine
7. `AlgoOrder.attached_gtts_json` populated with context (idempotent; re-fire = no-op)
8. OrderCard chip renders `tmpl:#N ✓`

### Wing hedge chain scan

When resolving wing (Phase 1B):

```
parent = SELL NIFTY25APR22000CE (example)
scope = NIFTY25APR22XXX PE (same underlying + expiry, opposite type)
radius = wing_chain_radius (default ±20 strikes)
```

Broker.quote() fetches ~40 candidate PE strikes. Score each by: `|ltp − wing_premium_pct × parent_ltp| + spread_penalty`. Filter out OI < wing_min_oi and spread% > wing_max_spread_pct. Pick closest-scored candidate (greedy).

If no candidates pass the filters, wing skips (error logged; parent still places). Common on low-liquidity options.

### Scaled close (multi-target TP)

Example `tp_scales_json`:
```json
[
  {"at_pct": 50, "close_pct": 30},
  {"at_pct": 100, "close_pct": 40},
  {"at_pct": 150, "close_pct": 30}
]
```

When parent (100 qty) fills → create 3 GTTs:
- GTT 1: trigger at fill × 1.50 → close 30 qty (30%)
- GTT 2: trigger at fill × 2.00 → close 40 qty (40%)
- GTT 3: trigger at fill × 2.50 → close 30 qty (30%)

Total closed: 100 qty. Each GTT is independent (fires in any order, doesn't block others). Qty allocation uses floor + remainder-fix so the sum always equals parent qty.

### Trailing stop mechanics

When parent fills + sl_trail_pct is set:

```
for long:
  highest_ltp_seen = fill_price
  initial_trigger = fill_price × (1 - sl_pct)
  
  [every trail_poll_interval_seconds]
  highest_ltp_seen = max(highest_ltp_seen, current_ltp)
  current_trigger = highest_ltp_seen × (1 - sl_trail_pct)
  if current_trigger > initial_trigger:
    broker.modify_gtt(trigger=current_trigger, price=current_trigger)
```

For shorts, invert (lowest_ltp_seen, subtraction becomes addition). Context (`highest_ltp_seen`, `current_trigger`, etc.) lives in `AlgoOrder.attached_gtts_json` so the task survives restarts.

### Troubleshooting table

| Issue | Check |
|---|---|
| Template not attaching after fill | Order's `attached_gtts_json` null? Check `/api/admin/logs` for "template attach error". As of Sprint A the attach fires from FOUR paths: postback handler, chase terminal, reconcile path, AND paper-engine fill. If one of those is silent the row still has another shot. Per-row `asyncio.Lock` (WeakValueDictionary) serialises concurrent fire attempts so duplicate GTTs can't be placed. |
| Wing not filling / showing wrong strike | Check `templates.wing_min_oi` and `templates.wing_max_spread_pct` settings. Highly illiquid options may have no candidates. Check broker logs. |
| Trailing stop not advancing | Check `templates.trail_poll_interval_seconds` (default 30s). Two-leg OCO trails: Sprint A persists `tp_trigger` in `attached_gtts_json` so the poller can pass both `[tp, new_sl]` to `modify_gtt`. Pre-Sprint-A entries without `tp_trigger` log a one-time INFO line and skip — re-attach to enable trailing. Dhan OCO trail: Sprint C fixed the silent ENTRY_LEG-only bug; both legs now modify correctly. Groww: `modify_gtt` for compound `oco:` ids is not yet wired for trail (it's emulated single trails only). |
| Operator says "I can't pick my template in OrderTicket" | Confirm template `is_active=True` (soft-delete, if you want to hide it). No UI toggle yet; DB edit required (or re-save from admin form). |
| Scale-out close_pct doesn't sum to 100% | Submit will raise 422 validation error. Fix in the template form; cumulative must be ≤ 100% (can be less if operator wants some qty to remain). |
| Operator sees "Groww OCO emulated — ~15s race window" warning chip | Expected behaviour — Groww has no native OCO. Mitigation: lower `templates.oco_pair_poll_seconds` (default 15s) at the cost of more broker.get_gtts() polling. For zero race window, use Kite or Dhan. |
| Operator sees "Dhan Forever Order does not cover MCX/NCO" error | Expected — Dhan's Forever Order doesn't cover commodity. The error is raised at `place_gtt` time with a clear RuntimeError so the operator can mirror the parent to a Kite account before re-attaching. |
| Postback handler 500s after Kite fill, with Dhan/Groww accounts loaded | Pre-Sprint-A bug — `.api_secret` was called on every connection and Dhan/Groww raised AttributeError. Sprint A skips non-Kite connections in the HMAC loop. If you see this in old logs from before `24cced42`, the symptom would be Kite retrying the postback every few seconds. |
| Partial-fill chase looks like it's stuck | Sprint B + D — chase loop's `_record_partial_fill` accumulates `filled_quantity` across partials and rolls a qty-weighted `fill_price`. Row `detail` reads `PARTIAL N/M @ ₹X (chasing residual M-N)`. MCX: Sprint D's `from_kite_qty` reverse-translates lots to contracts before the partial comparison, so a 1-lot fill on a 100-contract MCX order no longer triggers a phantom partial every poll. Persistent state writes happen on every partial so a chase that aborts at max_attempts shows the truthful UNFILLED residual, not the original ask. |

## Agent execution — every 5 min during market hours

Broker data → summarise → `run_cycle()` for each ACTIVE agent:
1. Market open?
2. Cooldown finished?
3. Condition matches?
4. Material change since last alert?
5. Fire: Telegram + email + log + actions

Gates: cooldown (spam), baseline (open-bell), suppression (flat loss)

---

## Anatomy of an agent

Every row on the **Agents** page (`/agents`) has four moving parts:

### 1. Conditions — the rule itself

Conditions are a tree you can read left-to-right. Three shapes are allowed:

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **leaf** | A single test: `metric` + `scope` + `operator` + `value` |
| **all** | AND of children — every child must be true |
| **any** | OR of children — at least one child must be true |
| **not** | NEGATION — true when the child is false |

A leaf looks like this in JSON:

```json
{
  "metric": "pnl",
  "scope":  "positions.any_acct",
  "op":     "<=",
  "value":  -30000
}
```

Read it in English:
> "The **pnl** (metric) of **any account's positions** (scope) is **≤** (operator) **₹-30,000** (value)."

A composite tree:

```json
{
  "any": [
    { "metric": "day_pct", "scope": "holdings.any_acct", "op": "<=", "value": -3.0 },
    { "metric": "day_pct", "scope": "holdings.total",    "op": "<=", "value": -5.0 }
  ]
}
```

> "Either any account's day loss is at least 3 %, or the total day loss is at least 5 %."

### 2. Notify channels

```json
[
  { "channel": "telegram", "enabled": true },
  { "channel": "email",    "enabled": true }
]
```
Mix and match: `telegram` / `email` / `websocket` / `log`.

### 3. Actions

`[]` = alert only. Otherwise:
```json
[{"type": "chase_close_positions", "params": {"account": "ZG0790", "exchange": "NFO"}}]
```

See **Tokens** page for all action types.

### 4. Metadata

- **Scope**: `total` or `per_account`
- **Schedule**: `market_hours` or `always`
- **Cooldown**: default 30 min
- **Status**: `active` / `inactive`

---

## Tokens — vocabulary for agent conditions

Every `metric`, `scope`, `op`, `channel`, `action_type` must be registered at `/admin/tokens`.

**Three categories:**
- **Condition**: `metric`, `scope`, `operator` — what agents can check?
- **Notify**: `channel`, `format`, `template` — how to alert?
- **Action**: `action_type` — what to do?

**System vs custom**: System (ship with app, toggle-only) vs Custom (full CRUD)

### Token row fields

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Token** | The word (e.g. `pnl`, `<=`, `telegram`) |
| **Category** | `condition` / `notify` / `action` |
| **Token kind** | `metric` / `scope` / `operator` / `channel` / `action_type` |
| **Value type** | `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `enum`, `array`, `object`, `void` |
| **Units** | For metrics: `₹`, `%`, `₹/min`, `%/min`, `min` |
| **Description** | Tooltip in Agents editor |
| **Resolver** | Python dotted path (required for system tokens) |
| **Params schema** | For action tokens — JSON schema of arguments |
| **Enum values** | Allowed strings for enum types |
| **Template body** | Message body with `${placeholder}` syntax |

### Creating a token

1. `/admin/tokens` → **+ New token**
2. Pick Category and Token kind
3. Fill Token, Description, Value type, Units
4. For actions: define `params_schema` (JSON)
5. Save → **Reload registry** (yellow button, top right)

New token usable immediately without server restart.

### Integration with Agents editor

- Dropdowns auto-populate from Tokens table
- **Validate** button checks tokens against registry (catches typos)
- **Actions editor** renders form from action token's `params_schema`

Tokens page is the single extension point: new check = 1 token row + 1 Python function, no engine code change.

---

## Creating an agent

1. `/agents` → expand a row → **Edit**
2. Fill: Name / Description / Scope / Schedule / Cooldown / Conditions (JSON) / Events / Actions
3. **Validate** → **Save**
4. Flip OFF pill to ON when ready

**Tip**: Copy a seeded `loss-*` agent and edit thresholds — fastest way to learn.

---

## The Simulator — test agents safely

`/admin/execution?mode=sim` feeds fabricated data through the real agent engine. All alerts tagged `SIMULATOR`.

**Page surface:**
- Status bar: `RUNNING` / `idle`, scenario, tick count
- Controls: scenario dropdown · seed mode · rate · Load live book · Start/Stop/Step · Run cycle · Clear sim
- Recent SIMULATOR agent events table
- Recent SIMULATOR orders table
- LogPanel **Simulator** tab: per-tick price diffs in real time

### Market-state presets

| Preset | Simulates |
|---|---|
| `pre_open`, `at_open`, `mid_session` (default), `pre_close`, `at_close`, `post_close`, `expiry_day` | Realistic market clock for time-aware agents |

Set via: Simulator page dropdown (most specific) → scenario YAML → default. Run-in-Simulator button auto-picks sensible preset.

### Tick cadence

Simulator is **positions-only** (holdings aren't simulated). Holdings agents get a clear error. Positions refresh every tick by default (cadence = 1). Override via: Pos / N input (most specific) → scenario YAML → `/admin/settings`. Margin patches (`set_margin`) fire on scheduled ticks independent of cadence.

### Seeding modes

| Mode | Starting state | Use |
|---|---|---|
| **Scripted** | Scenario's `initial` block | Deterministic regression test |
| **Live** | Real Kite positions snapshot | Stress your actual book |
| **Live + scenario** | Real snapshot + scenario extras | Real book + hypothetical moves |

Manual **Load live book** for a fresh snapshot before starting.

### Running a simulation

1. `/admin/execution?mode=sim` → pick scenario (start with `generic-crash`)
2. Pick seed mode → **Load live book** if using Live / Live+scenario
3. Set **Rate** (2000 ms = 1 tick/2 sec) → **Start**
4. Watch **Simulator** tab at bottom for per-symbol price diffs
5. Auto-stops at 30 min; click red **Stop** to exit early

### Testing one agent

On `/agents` page, every row has **Run in Simulator** button. Pre-arms the page to run only that agent, bypassing schedule / cooldown / baseline gates. Safest way to test before activating.

### Underlying-driven F&O scenarios

For options + futures books, the simulator can move the **underlying spot** (NIFTY, BANKNIFTY, etc.) and have every contract on that underlying re-price coherently — so a "−3% NIFTY" tick gives you realistic gamma + skew effects instead of moving each strike in isolation.

**How it works (one paragraph)**: at sim start, the driver detects every underlying in your book, snapshots its spot price (from a futures contract on it, or from `scenario.initial.underlyings`, or as a crude ATM proxy), and calibrates **implied volatility per option** by inverting Black-Scholes against each option's current premium. When you fire an `underlying_pct -0.03` move, the spot drops 3 %, and every option re-prices via Black-Scholes with the IV that was locked at start. Futures track spot 1:1.

**Two new built-in scenarios**:

| Slug | What it does |
|---|---|
| `nifty-down-3pct` | NIFTY spot −1% / −2% / −3% over three ticks. ITM puts inflate, OTM calls collapse, futures fall 1:1. |
| `nifty-up-3pct`   | NIFTY spot +1% / +2% / +3% over three ticks. ITM calls inflate, OTM puts collapse — squeezes short-call writers. |

**Use it like this**:
1. `/admin/execution?mode=sim` → press **Load live book** → switch Seed to **Live** or **Live + scenario**.
2. Pick `nifty-down-3pct`.
3. Press **Start**.
4. Watch the chart panel — the NIFTY chart (sky-blue `SPOT` tag) shows the 3 % drop; each option chart (amber `F&O` tag) shows the derived premium move with the underlying overlaid as a dashed sky-blue line.

**Caveats**:
- Vega and theta are intentionally ignored — sim runs are minutes, not days.
- IV is locked at sim start. Real-world IV expands during sell-offs; the sim doesn't model that. If you want to study IV-expansion effects, layer a per-option `pct` move on top of the underlying move.
- Stock-option books need explicit underlyings in `scenario.initial.underlyings: {RELIANCE: 2800}` if no futures contract is in the book — the driver can't resolve a stock spot from an arbitrary option chain alone.

### Adding custom positions to a sim run

Don't have the position you want to test in your live book? Add it inline:

1. `/admin/execution?mode=sim` → scroll to the **Custom positions** panel below the controls.
2. Click **+ Add row** → fill in the row:

   | Field | Example | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | Symbol | `NIFTY25APR22000CE` | Any Kite-style F&O symbol or cash equity |
   | Qty | `-50` | Negative = short, positive = long |
   | LTP | `180` | Last-traded price; used as the seed |
   | Account | (blank) | Defaults to `ZG####` if blank — the engine treats it as a label |

3. Add as many rows as you want. Click the red **×** to remove a row.
4. Press **Start** — your custom rows are layered on top of whatever scripted/live seeding produced. F&O symbols re-price coherently when an `underlying_*` move fires; cash equities track simple `pct/abs` moves.

This is the right move for "what-if" testing before you take a real trade — you see exactly how the agent engine + chase + Black-Scholes pricing react to the position, without ever sending an order to the broker.

---

## Execution mode — navbar dropdown only

Five modes: SIM (rose) · PAPER (sky-blue) · LIVE (red) · SHADOW (orange) · REPLAY (green). Branch gate: `main` allows any; non-`main` forces PAPER. Confirm modal before LIVE → PAPER/SHADOW. Telegram tag: empty = LIVE, `[PAPER]` = PAPER mode.

---

## Paper mode dashboard (`/admin/execution?mode=paper`)

Real Kite quotes + paper engine. Status: `CHASING` (orders in flight) · `IDLE` (enabled, no orders) · `DEV` (non-main). Chase pills (side / qty / symbol / limit / attempts) + chart grid + LogPanel Orders tab. Watch the live chase without broker touches; compare to `[PAPER]` Telegram alerts.

---

## Basket orders — multi-leg, multi-account

Orders > Ticket tab: **+ Basket** button → add legs, pick account per pill. Margin strip shows Required / Avail / After per account. Routes: `GET /api/orders/basket/margin`, `POST /api/orders/basket` (PAPER), `POST /api/orders/basket/place` (LIVE).

---

## Auto profit target

OrderTicket carries Target row. Default `algo.default_target_pct` (ships +30%), override per-ticket (% ↔ ₹ toggle). On fill: auto-places LIMIT TP order (SELL for long, BUY for short) at fill × (1 + target_pct).

---

## Derivatives page — `/admin/derivatives`

Three visual sections:
- **ITM ON EXPIRY** (amber) — NSE ITM = spot > CE strike or < PE strike; action required before close
- **NETTED** (slate, MCX only) — CE/PE pairs netting to zero auto-settle; informational
- **OUT OF THE MONEY** (muted) — expire worthless; informational

### Picker & settings

Underlying dropdown filters by book. Pick underlying → load every option + future as checkboxes. Add drafts via `+` (option-chain picker). Settings: `connections.price_account` (Kite account for Greeks/margin/historical; blank = first available) · `algo.default_target_pct` (default +30%).

---

## Symbol identity

Charts, Derivatives, Positions display: root (CRUDEOIL, GOLDM) + contract chip (CRUDEOIL26JUNFUT). Contract chip amber when ≤3 days to expiry. Auto-resolve: `NIFTY 50` → `NIFTY26JUNFUT` · `CRUDEOIL` → `CRUDEOILM26JUNFUT` · equity → `NSE:<SYM>` spot.

## Options analytics (`/admin/derivatives`)

A separate workspace from the tick-chart pages — this is for **options research**: pick an underlying, see the aggregated payoff for everything you hold on it, plus the Greeks and risk metrics on the side. One leg or twenty — same view; the page doesn't distinguish single-leg from multi-leg.

### Picker bar

Two dropdowns and a `+` toggle. That's it.

| Control | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Account** (multi-select) | Scopes which broker accounts the candidates pull from. Blank = all accounts. |
| **Underlying** (single-select) | NIFTY / BANKNIFTY / FINNIFTY / … — derived from your loaded book. Picks the universe. |
| **+ / −** (toggle pill) | Opens an **option-chain** picker; clicks land as **drafts** (hypothetical positions) you can edit. |

Live vs sim is auto-detected. While a simulator is running the page works off sim positions and the header carries a `SIMULATOR` chip; otherwise it works off your live broker book. No mode switch — just pick the underlying.

The **stat overlay** in the top-left corner of the chart shows the at-a-glance numerics — **SPOT**, **TDAY** P&L (today's value at spot, BS-priced), **EXP** P&L (expiry value at spot, intrinsic), **MAX P** (max profit), **MAX L** (max loss). Color-coded green/red so you can read the position health at a glance without looking at the side cards. The chart's hover tooltip uses the same `TDAY` / `EXP` labels for consistency.

### Adding draft positions

Click `+` to open the option-chain picker. Pick an expiry, browse strikes, click `+ CE` / `+ PE` next to any row (or a futures pill above the strike grid) to drop the contract into **Drafts**. Drafts whose symbol matches the selected underlying surface in Candidates immediately and feed the strategy analytics like any other leg. Edit qty / avg cost / LTP inline; hit `×` to drop a draft.

Drafts are how you model contracts you don't own — "what if I add NIFTY24500CE to my book?". They sit beside live + sim positions in Candidates and the chart re-renders on every checkbox toggle.

### Key metrics — what they mean

| Metric | What it tells you |
|---|---|
| **BS theo** | Black-Scholes fair value at the current spot, IV, and DTE. |
| **Diff** | Market LTP minus theoretical. Positive = market is asking more than fair (you'd be overpaying to buy). Negative = market is cheap (potential edge, or a stale quote). |
| **IV** | Implied volatility back-solved from the current LTP. The chart and Greeks use this σ — change it via the URL query if you want a what-if. |
| **Delta** | ₹ change in option value per ₹1 change in spot. Position-scaled = delta × signed qty (long short calls have negative delta). |
| **Gamma** | Rate of change of delta. Tiny number for index options; multiply by 100 to get "delta change per ₹100 spot move". |
| **Theta** | Daily time decay in rupees. Always negative for long options, positive for short. |
| **Vega** | ₹ change per 1 % IV change. Sign tells you if you're long or short volatility. |
| **Rho** | ₹ change per 1 % risk-free rate change. Mostly cosmetic for short-dated index options. |
| **Max profit / loss** | Position-level absolute rupees at expiry. ∞ for unlimited-payoff legs (long calls, short puts). |
| **Breakeven** | Spot price at expiry where position P&L is zero. |
| **POP (probability of profit)** | P(spot at expiry crosses your breakeven), under the Black-Scholes log-normal assumption. Greater than 60 % shows green; less than 40 % red. |

### Pricing-account setting

The page (and the paper-trading underlying-spot fetch) routes shared market-data calls through whichever account is set as `connections.price_account` in [Settings](`/admin/settings`). Blank = auto-pick the first account in `secrets.yaml`. Pin it explicitly if you want a specific Kite handle to take the load.

### Caveats

- **Single underlying per chart**. All checked candidates must share the same underlying — the page rejects mixed underlyings (would be unplottable on one x-axis). Pick a different Underlying to see a different book.
- **Single expiry per chart**. All legs must share the same expiry. Calendar / diagonal spreads aren't supported yet — uncheck the off-expiry leg in Candidates.
- **IV is locked at the moment of the call**. The page polls every 5 s so a fast-moving market refreshes the IV calibration; the payoff curve uses whatever σ the latest poll resolved.

### Stale prices — what to do when the broker has nothing to say

When you're looking at an option that's illiquid, off-hours, or just had a stale quote, the page shows **yellow `stale: <source>` chips** so you know which numbers came from a fallback. The fallback chain:

1. **live** — the broker's current `last_price`. This is what you want.
2. **close** — yesterday's closing price (from the broker's `ohlc.close`). Useful when the market is closed or a contract just hasn't traded today.
3. **depth** — midpoint of the top-of-book bid/ask. Last resort when there's no live trade and no recent close.
4. **avg_cost** — the average cost from your position. Falls back to "what you paid" when literally nothing else is available.
5. **default IV** — an amber `·default` tag on the IV cell means the calibrator couldn't extract a sensible σ (typically because the LTP itself was a fallback) and used 15 % as a reasonable working assumption.

The payoff curve still draws regardless. The Greeks and POP computed off a stale price are best treated as "shape-of-position" — directionally right, but don't rely on the absolute rupee numbers when the chip is yellow.

### Building a complex strategy

Picking an underlying loads every option + future you hold on it into Candidates. To model a hypothetical strategy on top:

1. Click `+` to open the option-chain picker.
2. Pick the expiry from the chain dropdown, optionally toggle Long / Short.
3. Click `+ CE` / `+ PE` next to a strike (or a futures pill) to drop a draft into your basket. The contract appears in Drafts (editable) and Candidates (checkable) immediately.
4. Tick / untick rows in Candidates to include / exclude legs from the payoff. The chart auto-updates.

The chart marks every leg's strike and every breakeven (an iron condor draws 2; a butterfly 2; a vertical 1). The side panel surfaces:

- **Net cost** — debit / credit; sign tells you whether you paid or collected.
- **Position Greeks** (Δ Γ Θ V ρ) — summed across legs, signed by qty.
- **Risk + EV** — max profit / loss within the charted spot range, R:R, every breakeven, POP, expected value.

Use it before you put on a complex trade — pick the legs, look at the BE markers and POP, *then* hit the broker. The numbers won't lie.



### Charts — see what the price did

While a sim is running, the page renders one **mini chart per active symbol** directly under the position pills:

- Amber line — last-traded price tick by tick
- Faint cyan band — bid/ask spread
- Markers:
  - **Amber** dot — order placed (where the chase started)
  - **Emerald** dot — order filled
  - **Red** dot — order unfilled (chase gave up)

Hover any marker to see the side, fill price, and order id. The chart polls every 3 s and persists across fills, so once a position closes you can still see the full trajectory that led to it.

The same chart grid renders inline on `/admin/execution?mode=paper` so you can watch the live chase engine in **paper mode** (mode 2) on prod. The Activity LogPanel below carries the canonical 6-tab strip but no standalone Chart tab — every page that needs charts mounts them as first-class page content rather than buried inside a log tab.

History is in-memory only (no DB writes). The buffer holds ~20 minutes of per-symbol history at the default tick rates; older points fall off automatically. A service restart resets the chart — that's by design (the chart is for live monitoring, not post-mortem).

### What gets tagged

Because `sim_mode=True` flows through the pipeline, every artefact is marked:

| Surface | Tag |
|---|---|
| Telegram | `SIMULATOR` prefix + red "SIMULATOR RUN — fabricated market data" line |
| Email subject | `RamboQuant SIMULATOR Agent: …` |
| Email body | Red banner at the top |
| agent_events row | `sim_mode = true` |
| algo_orders row | `mode = 'sim'` |
| Log line | `[SIM] …` (short prefix to conserve log width) |

So real alerts and simulated alerts are never in the same bucket.

### While the sim runs

- The red **SIMULATOR ACTIVE** banner pins to the top of every admin page.
- The `/agents` page's event table auto-switches to showing only sim events.
- The `/performance` page keeps showing **real** data — the live Kite refresh continues even during a sim, only the live agent engine is paused.

## Proxy hedges — GOLDBEES ↔ GOLD options

Automatically converts ETF holdings to option-hedging equivalents. Pick GOLDM → GOLDBEES auto-surfaces in Legs with gram-equiv + lot count. All-live math: `market_val = qty × LTP`, `effective_qty = β × market_val ÷ spot`, `lots = effective_qty ÷ lot_size`. No factor table.

Seeded defaults: GOLDBEES/SILVERBEES ↔ GOLD/GOLDM; NIFTYBEES ↔ NIFTY; BANKBEES ↔ BANKNIFTY. For retail books, GOLDM/SILVERM more practical than full-size GOLD/SILVER lots.

### Adding pairs & computing β

`/admin/settings → Hedge proxies → + Add`. ETF pairs work immediately (β=1.0 implicit). For stock-vs-index: **Compute β** button runs 60-day regression (~5s). Auto-recompute daily at 02:30 IST for rows older than `hedge_proxies.regression_max_age_days` (default 7).

Settings: `regression_enabled` · `regression_window_days` (60) · `regression_max_age_days` (7). Row shows: β | R² | date of last run | **Compute β** button.

### Failed regression — `regression_error` column

Sprint D added the `regression_error` column to the `hedge_proxies` table. Every failed regression run writes a one-line reason here ("too few overlapping bars (n=8, need ≥ 15)", "broker error: rate-limited", etc.); every successful run clears it. The admin row shows ⚠ next to the date with the error in the tooltip; on `/admin/derivatives` the PROXY chip turns red ⚠ instead of amber when the error is present.

The chip's age tag carries three states:
- **No suffix** (β fresh, ≤ 2 days) — green/normal styling.
- **"β computed Nd ago"** with amber tag — β is 2–7 days old, still usable but ageing.
- **"⚠ regression failed: <reason>"** OR **"β computed Nd ago (STALE)"** with red tag — last attempt errored, OR β is older than 7 days. Hit Compute β to retry.

### Pathological β rejection

Sprint E added a `|β| > 5` guard in `_compute_regression`. A pathological β value typically comes from a single bad bar (split day, bad tick, fat-finger trade) driving the regression off the rails. Bloomberg PRM caps to ±3; we're slightly more permissive (5) because leveraged ETFs can legitimately overshoot. Rejection logs a clear WARNING line and the regression returns `(None, None, n)` so the caller treats it identically to "too few bars".

### ETF check: GOLDBEES → GOLD

After the first regression run you'll see something like `β=0.98 R²=0.99`. That's the empirical confirmation that GOLDBEES tracks gold spot ~1:1. The math doesn't change (it uses β when set, falls back to 1.0 when NULL), but you now have validation that the proxy is working.

## Settings — runtime tunables

The Settings page (`/admin/settings`) is where you tune the knobs that change more often than a deploy cycle: alert thresholds, refresh cadences, simulator defaults, and the **execution mode** flags that decide whether an action hits the broker or stays in paper. Edits take effect on the **next agent tick / sim run** — no service restart, no redeploy.

### Page layout

Each parameter is a single row:

```
[i]   alerts.cooldown_minutes  [mod]      [   30   ] min   [ Save ]  [ Reset ]
```

- **(i)** — click the amber chip to expand a panel showing the description, default, range, and units. Click again to collapse. Use it when you don't recognise a key.
- **`[mod]` badge** — appears when the live value differs from the code-shipped default.
- **Value field** — input adapts to the type: text for strings, number with min/max for ints/floats, dropdown for booleans / enums.
- **Save** — disabled until you change the value. Writes the new value and refreshes the row.
- **Reset** — disabled until the row is modified. Restores the code-shipped default.

A **filter box** at the top searches both keys and descriptions — useful when you know roughly what you want but not the exact key.

Categories are rendered in deliberate order — **execution → alerts → algo → performance → simulator → notifications → logging → misc** — so the things you'll actually touch sit at the top of the page.

### Settings vs YAML

Settings are for runtime knobs an operator changes without thinking about a deploy. **Infrastructure parameters stay in YAML deliberately**:

| In Settings (DB) | In `backend_config.yaml` |
|---|---|
| Alert thresholds, cooldowns | DB credentials |
| Refresh cadences | Market hours |
| Sim defaults | Kite URLs |
| Execution mode flags | IPv6 source addresses |
| Notification toggles | Capability flags (`cap_in_<branch>`) |
| Log levels | Log file paths |

The seeder behaves well across deploys: it inserts new keys, refreshes descriptions / schemas / defaults, **preserves your overrides**, and auto-prunes keys that have been retired in code.

### Execution mode banner

The first thing you see on the page is the execution mode banner:

- **Red — `LIVE mode`** — `execution.paper_trading_mode = False`. Every fired agent that wants to hit Kite places a real broker order. This is the seeded default on a fresh install.
- **Green — `PAPER mode`** — `execution.paper_trading_mode = True`. Every fired agent writes a paper `AlgoOrder` row instead of touching Kite. Real positions don't change.
- **Pink — `SIMULATOR running`** / **Orange — `SHADOW mode`** / **Sky — `REPLAY running`** — the corresponding mode is active.

The single master toggle `execution.paper_trading_mode` (flipped via the navbar dropdown or `/admin/execution`) decides PAPER vs LIVE; no per-action flags. SHADOW and REPLAY are separate opt-ins on top.

### The five execution modes

Every agent fire that touches the broker gets routed by mode:

| Mode | Where it runs | Quote source | Trade engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Simulator** | Both dev + prod (via navbar SIM) | Fabricated (scenario-driven) | `PaperTradeEngine` against fabricated bid/ask |
| **2 — Paper** | Prod when `paper_trading_mode=True`; dev always | Real Kite quote API (batched) | `PaperTradeEngine` against live bid/ask, validated by Kite's `basket_margin` |
| **3 — Live** | Prod when `paper_trading_mode=False` (default on fresh install) | Real Kite | Real `place_order` / `modify_order` / `cancel_order` |
| **4 — Shadow** | Prod when `shadow_mode=True` | Real Kite | Logged payload + `basket_margin` only; no execution |
| **5 — Replay** | Both dev + prod | Historical OHLCV candles | `PaperTradeEngine` against historical bid/ask |

The `main` branch is a **hard outer gate**: on dev (any non-main branch), every broker-hitting action is forced to paper regardless of `execution.paper_trading_mode`.

Every alert email + Telegram message gets a tag so you can tell at a glance what mode the actions ran in:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| (no tag) | Every broker action in this fire ran live (master toggle `execution.paper_trading_mode=False`) |
| `[PAPER]` | Every broker action in this fire was paper (master toggle `execution.paper_trading_mode=True`) |

### Recommended promotion order

Promotion is now a single master-toggle flip (`execution.paper_trading_mode`), not per-action flags. The recommended path:

1. Soak with the master toggle at `True` (PAPER) and watch the chase loop on `/admin/execution?mode=paper`
2. Watch the LogPanel's Order tab — every fire writes an `AlgoOrder` row with `mode='paper'` and Kite's `basket_margin` verdict in `.detail`. REJECTED rows tell you "Kite would have kicked this back anyway."
3. When the fires look right, flip the navbar dropdown to LIVE. The next agent fire hits the real broker.

If anything looks off in LIVE mode, flip the navbar dropdown back to PAPER. The next tick reverts every action to paper. No per-action staging — one master toggle owns the whole pipeline.

### How edits take effect

Most settings update on the next agent tick (5-minute cadence). A few are special-cased:

- **`performance.refresh_interval`** / **`performance.market_refresh_time`** — picked up live by the background loop.
- **`alerts.*`** — applied next time `run_cycle` fires.
- **`execution.paper_trading_mode`** / **`execution.shadow_mode`** — applied at the next mode-resolution call (effectively immediately).

You don't have to memorise this — the **(i)** info chip on each row tells you what the setting governs.

## Brokers — `/admin/brokers`

Manage accounts via UI, no SSH/YAML/restart. Page: account table (code | broker | API key | source IP | status pill | notes | Test/Edit/Delete) + **+ New account** button.

**Add account**: code (unique) · broker (kite) · API key/secret/password/TOTP (encrypted at rest) · source IP (IPv6 for multi-account Kite binding) · notes. Click **Test** to verify.

**Edit**: click Edit → secret fields blank by default (blank = unchanged) → edit + Save.

**Capabilities endpoint** (`GET /api/admin/brokers/{account}/capabilities`): returns `BrokerCapabilities` dataclass (gtt_single / gtt_oco / gtt_modify / etc.) for in-page feature gating (OrderTicket warning chips).

## Investor portal — mint URL for an LP

LP-facing read-only page at `/investor/<token>` showing the LP's NAV slice + 180-day curve. **Token is the credential** — no LP login, no password. Operator mints + forwards URL through their own channel (WhatsApp / email).

**Mint a URL:**
1. `/admin` → find the LP's user row → click **Portal** (cyan button, designated-only)
2. Modal opens. Set **Expires in** (default 90 days, cap 10y) + optional **Note** (e.g. "WhatsApp to LP 2026-06-23")
3. Click **Mint** → the full URL appears in a green panel
4. Click **Copy** → paste into WhatsApp / email → send to LP

**Token is shown ONCE.** After the modal closes the token-list table surfaces only the first-8-char preview. To re-share, mint a new one.

**Revoke a URL:**
- Same modal lists every minted token (active / revoked / expired pills + last-visit timestamp + visit count)
- Click **Revoke** on the row → confirm → URL 401s immediately on next visit
- Idempotent — revoking an already-revoked row is a no-op

**Operator visibility:**
- `last_visit_at` + `visit_count` on each row so you can see "this LP last looked at statements 3 weeks ago" without leaving the modal
- Visit counter increments per slice + per history fetch (so a single page load bumps it by 2)

**Endpoints:**

| Route | Cap | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/users/{id}/investor-tokens` | `manage_investor_tokens` | List rows (no full token, just preview) |
| `POST /api/admin/users/{id}/investor-tokens` | `manage_investor_tokens` | Mint (returns full token + portal URL ONCE) |
| `DELETE /api/admin/users/{id}/investor-tokens/{tid}` | `manage_investor_tokens` | Revoke |
| `GET /api/investor/{token}/slice` | none — token in URL | Current NAV slice (public) |
| `GET /api/investor/{token}/history?days=180` | none — token in URL | NAV curve (public) |

**Cap**: `manage_investor_tokens` is admin-only. Trader / risk / ops cannot mint — LP onboarding is a designated activity.

**Math** (units model — slice 7N+):

```
units_held(user, t)   = Σ units_delta for events <= t
total_units(t)        = Σ units_held across every LP
nav_per_unit(t)       = firm_nav(t) / total_units(t)
slice(user, t)        = units_held × nav_per_unit
cost_basis(user, t)   = Σ amount (sub+bootstrap) − Σ amount (redemption)
pnl(user, t)          = slice − cost_basis
```

All four surfaces — `/api/nav/me`, `/api/nav/me/history`, `/api/investor/{token}/slice` + `/history`, and the monthly PDF — use the same `investor_units.compute_slice()` helper.

**Auto-bootstrap** runs on first compute. For every eligible LP (active + share_pct > 0) without events, inserts one synthetic event:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `event_type` | `bootstrap` |
| `units_delta` | `User.share_pct` |
| `amount` | `User.contribution` |
| `nav_per_unit` | `contribution / share_pct` (or `1.0` when contribution=0) |
| `event_date` | `contribution_date` → `created_at` → today (fallback chain) |
| `note` | `auto-bootstrap from v1 share_pct` |

When share_pcts sum to 100 across all eligible LPs, this reproduces v1 numbers exactly. When sum != 100 (operator residual implied via low share_pct), units math redistributes proportionally and slices sum to `firm_nav` by construction.

**Verifying bootstrap after deploy:**

1. Hit `/nav` once (as the operator, or any authenticated LP) → triggers auto-bootstrap
2. Open `/admin` → pick an eligible LP → Portal → Events tab → confirm one `Bootstrap` pill row exists with the right `units_delta` + `amount`
3. Spot-check `slice = units_held × nav_per_unit` against the headline value the LP sees

**Logging real subscription / redemption events:**

In `/admin` → user row → Portal → Events tab → Add event:

| Field | What to enter |
|---|---|
| Type | Subscription (capital in) / Redemption (capital out) / Bootstrap (correction) |
| Date | `YYYY-MM-DD` of the bank transfer / wire |
| Amount | Positive rupees, regardless of direction |
| NAV/unit | Per-unit value on that date (compute from firm_nav ÷ total_units, or trust the operator's reconciliation) |
| Note | Optional — e.g. "Wire ref 12345" |

The backend computes signed `units_delta = ±amount/nav_per_unit` automatically.

**Security model:** The URL IS the credential, same shape as Carta / SS&C investor magic-links. Don't email it to a shared inbox. If you suspect leakage, revoke + re-mint.

## OrderTicket modal

Single entry point for all order ops (open/close/modify/repeat/cancel) across all instruments. Auto-detects instrument kind from symbol (CNC/MIS for EQ, NRML/MIS for F&O). Side toggle: ADD/CLOSE (if position open) or BUY/SELL (if closed). Three submit modes: DRAFT (append to caller's array, `/admin/derivatives` chain clicks) · PAPER (`mode=paper`, real bid/ask via chase) · LIVE (branch=main + paper_trading_mode=False). Opens from: `/admin/derivatives` chain · every page-header Order icon (amber `+`)  · Chart icon (cyan line) · Activity icon (violet 3-line). Symbol anchors auto-resolve to contract (`NIFTY 50` → `NIFTY26JUNFUT`).

---

## Demo mode — public algo console

Anonymous prod visitors see real broker data with accounts masked (`ZG####`), can place paper orders (real chase loop, no broker touch). Zero maintenance — no fixture file.

Backend: `is_demo_request()` = main + no JWT. `auth_or_demo_guard` admits + sets `is_demo=True`. Write endpoints: `place`/`modify`/`cancel` 403; `/api/orders/ticket` downgrades `live → paper`. Read data masked via `mask_column()`.

Frontend: `branch=main + !user` = demo. Settings/Brokers/Users nav links hide. Navbar badges: `DEMO` (purple) / `PAPER` (blue) / `SIM` (red).

---

## Postback fan-out — book_changed bus

On every terminal order status from a broker postback (COMPLETE / CANCELLED / REJECTED / EXPIRED), the backend invalidates the orders + positions + holdings caches and broadcasts a `book_changed` WebSocket event. Every algo page subscribes to a shared debounced bus and refetches its primary loader in lockstep — single-iteration UI settle, replaces the prior "wait for the next 5–15 s poll" path.

**Backend chain** ([orders.py::order_postback](backend/api/routes/orders.py)):

```
postback received
  → invalidate("orders")               # always
  → if terminal:
      invalidate("positions")
      invalidate("holdings")
      broadcast({event: "book_changed", account, exchange,
                 tradingsymbol, reason, ts})
  → if COMPLETE:
      broadcast({event: "position_filled", qty: signed_delta, ...})
```

`position_filled` is preserved — it carries the signed-qty delta for the per-cell optimistic patch on Pulse + Performance. `book_changed` is the new coordinated coverage that ALSO catches cancel / reject paths.

**Frontend subscriber** ([$lib/data/bookChanged.js](frontend/src/lib/data/bookChanged.js)):

- Singleton WebSocket subscriber started from the algo layout's `onMount`. Idempotent — multiple calls share one connection.
- Listens for `book_changed`, debounces 200ms (coalesces basket-order bursts into one refresh), increments a monotonic `$bookChanged` store + sets `$lastBookEvent` to the latest payload.
- Pages subscribe with a `$effect` that watches the counter and calls their primary loader once per increment.

**Surfaces wired:**

| Page | Loader called on bookChanged |
|---|---|
| `/admin/derivatives` | `loadPositions()` + `loadStrategy()` |
| `/dashboard` | `loadHero()` |
| `/pulse` | `loadPulse()` |
| `/orders` | `_debouncedLoadOrders()` |
| `/performance` | `loadAll({ fresh: true })` |

**Troubleshooting:**

- **"Page didn't refresh after fill"** — open browser DevTools console; the bus warns when its WS startup fails. Hit page-header Refresh button to manually catch up.
- **"WebSocket keeps reconnecting"** — Cloudflare in orange-cloud mode blocks raw WS upgrades. `webhook.ramboq.com` MUST be grey cloud (DNS only). Verify in Cloudflare DNS settings.
- **"Bus fires too often"** — debounce is 200ms. A burst within that window collapses to one refresh; bursts spanning the window produce multiple refreshes (intended — distinct events should each trigger).

**Performance**: zero cost on the placement path. All invalidations + the broadcast run inside the existing `asyncio.create_task` block in the postback handler. The frontend bus pays one extra JSON parse per terminal status.

## History — `/admin/history`

Multi-day forensic surface for the three "book of record" datasets — Orders (every order the platform placed), Trades (broker-confirmed fills), Funds (per-account margins ledger). Cap-gated by `view_audit` (admin / risk / ops). Read-only; pairs with `/admin/audit` (event-level log) — this is the row-level book view.

**Endpoints** ([backend/api/routes/history.py](backend/api/routes/history.py)):

| Route | Source | Defaults | Pagination |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/admin/history/orders` | `algo_orders` table | last 30 days | 50/page, cap 500 |
| `GET /api/admin/history/trades` | `daily_book.kind='trades'` | last 30 days | 50/page, cap 500 |
| `GET /api/admin/history/funds`  | `daily_book.kind='funds'`  | last 90 days | unpaged (low cardinality) |

**Common filter params:** `from_date=YYYY-MM-DD`, `to_date=YYYY-MM-DD`, `accounts=ZG0790,DH3747` (comma-list), `symbols=NIFTY,GOLDM` (comma-list — Funds tab ignores this).

**Orders-specific filters:** `status=FILLED|OPEN|REJECTED|CANCELLED|UNFILLED`, `mode=live|paper|sim|shadow|replay`. Response includes a `counts` histogram so the UI's summary chip row can show "20 FILLED · 3 REJECTED · 1 OPEN" without paginating.

**Trades response** includes `summary.total_notional` (Σ qty × avg_cost across the full filtered set, computed in SQL so pagination doesn't degrade accuracy).

**Funds response** includes `earliest_date` — the first day funds capture wrote a row. The UI surfaces this as "Tracking started 23 Jun 2026" so the operator knows how far back the data goes.

**Funds capture** ([backend/api/algo/daily_snapshot.py::_funds_rows](backend/api/algo/daily_snapshot.py)):

- Runs inside the existing 15:35 IST `_task_daily_snapshot`.
- Per account, per segment (equity / commodity), one row per day. Idempotent via the existing `(date, account, kind, symbol)` unique constraint — re-running the same day's snapshot updates the row.
- Column mapping into `daily_book`:
  - `qty`           → `utilised.debits`            (₹ debited today)
  - `avg_cost`      → `available.cash`             (free cash)
  - `ltp`           → `available.opening_balance`  (SOD cash)
  - `day_pnl`       → `utilised.realised_m2m`      (today's realised P&L)
  - `total_pnl`     → `net`                        (segment net worth)
- Special sentinel: `symbol='__seg__'` (the table's unique constraint requires a symbol; funds rows are per-segment, not per-symbol).

**Known limits / next slices:**

- Funds **backfill** doesn't exist. Kite Connect has no programmatic ledger; Dhan has `get_funds_ledger` (could pull a one-shot historical seed). Until backfill lands, the Funds tab grows from today forward.
- **Cashbook view** (running balance reconstruction) — not yet. Reconstructing requires SOD balance + trade deltas + funds snapshot recon; a follow-up slice can layer that on as a 4th tab.
- **Per-row drill** — Orders rows don't yet link to the audit log via `request_id`; manual cross-reference via `/admin/audit` for now.

## Audit log — `/admin/audit`

Single forensic surface for every mutating event the platform produces. Cap-gated (`view_audit` — admin / risk / ops); writes happen via [`AuditMiddleware`](backend/api/audit.py) (HTTP) + `write_audit_event()` (non-HTTP). All writes are out-of-band via `asyncio.create_task` so **zero latency cost** on the caller's hot path.

**What's captured:**

| Category | Source | Actor |
|---|---|---|
| `order.place` | `POST /api/orders/ticket` | operator (JWT) |
| `order.modify` / `order.cancel` | `PUT/DELETE /api/orders/{id}` | operator |
| `order.fill` / `order.reject` | `POST /api/orders/postback` | `broker` |
| `agent.action` | every agent fire that triggers an action | `agent:<slug>` |
| `user` | `/api/admin/users/*` | operator |
| `config.broker` / `config.grammar` / `config.fragment` / `config.hedge` | `/api/admin/{brokers,grammar,fragments,hedge-proxies}/*` | operator |
| `system.nav` | NAV compute (daily 16:00 IST + ad-hoc) | `system` |
| `system.statement` | monthly statement send (1st of month) | `system` |
| `strategy` / `agent` | `/api/strategies/*`, `/api/agents/*` | operator |

**Filter pills** above the column filters scope the view: **All / Orders / Agents / Users / Config / System**. Each pill maps to one or more categories (comma-separated OR server-side). Combine with column filters (actor / action / target / status / since-hours) for drill-down.

**Capturing 4xx/5xx mutations:** OFF by default. Flip `audit.log_failed_mutations` to ON in `/admin/settings` when you want defect-tracking rows (e.g. "operator clicked SUBMIT and got 422; what blocked?"). Toggle off again afterwards — the audit log balloons with validation noise otherwise.

**Cross-referencing**: every row carries a `request_id` UUID mirrored in the `X-Request-ID` response header. To trace a specific operator action end-to-end: copy the request_id from the audit row, grep `api_log_file` on the server for that ID.

**Retention**: SEBI Cat-III requires 8-year retention. No auto-cleanup task today; the table is append-only and indexed.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Agent didn't fire | `/agents` last fire timestamp; also Simulator tab in log |
| Sim shows no price changes | Scripted mode needs `initial` block; try Live+scenario |
| Custom token invisible | Did you press **Reload registry**? Token `is_active=True`? |
| Alerts not reaching Telegram/email | Check `cap_in_<branch>.telegram` and `.mail` in `backend_config.yaml` |
| Settings change didn't take effect | Next agent tick ≤5 min; `logging.*` at Save. Dev branch forces paper anyway. |
| Fired but no broker order | Check `/admin/settings` execution flags; might be `execution.live.<action>=false` |
| Day P&L looks wrong | Verify against broker. Uses decomposed formula (see CLAUDE.md). MCX: ensure multiplier applied. |
| "Invalid username or password" | Admin resets password (no forgot-password flow yet) |

## Glossary

- **Branch**: `main` = prod, other = dev. Agents/tokens/sims on dev don't affect prod.
- **Capability flag**: `cap_in_<branch>.<feature>` in `backend_config.yaml` (simulator/telegram/mail/genai/market_feed).
- **Dispatch registry**: In-memory token → impl map, rebuilt at startup + **Reload registry**.
- **Execution mode**: Sim / paper / live, decided per agent fire. Sim = fabricated quotes + paper trade engine (dev only). Paper = real quotes + paper trade engine, validated by Kite's `basket_margin`. Live = real broker order. Per-action flags in **Settings** decide paper-vs-live on prod.
- **Masked account**: Accounts are rendered as `ZG####` / `ZJ####` in the UI and in alerts to avoid leaking numeric IDs. Internally the real IDs (`ZG0790`, `ZJ6294`) are used.
- **Tick**: One step of the simulator. Each tick applies a set of price moves and then invokes the agent engine once.
